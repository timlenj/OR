# My independent projects in Operations Research (self study). 
## Material I am working through:
* Discrete Optimization - Coursera - Professor Pascal Van Hentenryck
	* An introduction to Constraint Programming, Local Search, Linear Programming, Integer Programming
	* I am working through this course at my own pace. I've created solutions for the assignments using OR-Tools, others from scratch. I have also taken examples from the lectures and worked on solutions as well.
* Optimization in Operations Research - 2nd Edition - Ronald R. Rardin
* Volunteer Projects for Local Business
	* KING Trainer Scheduler

## Topics I am looking forward to exploring:
* More optimization
* Stochastic Programming and Modeling
	* MDPs -> ADPs -> Reinforcement Learning
* Simulation
